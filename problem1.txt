Explanation to the problem 1 (The mutilated chessboard)

The puzzle is impossible to complete, because of two same colored squares have been removed. (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem#Solution)

But the task was to formalize and report the factor graph. 

__Variables__

The varibales (or vertexes) will be every chessboard squares. And its value will be other associated square. The variable play role of pointer to  other associated square. 

__Domains__

The domain of each variable will be possiable free associated (neighbourhood) squares. Free means that associated square doesn't have value (doesn't point to any square)

__Constraints__

The only constraints is that the amount of free associated squares for every current square were at least 1.

__Recomandations__ 

I recomand assign value of free square, when some other square point to it.
